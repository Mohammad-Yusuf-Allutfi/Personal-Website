        <p><span id="what">What is Solar System?</span>The Solar System is a collection of celestial bodies consisting of a star called the Sun and all objects bound by its gravitational force. These objects include eight known planets with elliptical orbits, five dwarf planets, 290 natural satellites that have been identified, and millions of other celestial objects (meteors, asteroids, comets).</p>

            <p><span id="his">History </span>The five closest planets to the Sun besides Earth (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) have been known since ancient times because they can all be seen with the naked eye. Many nations in the world have their own names for each planet.
    
                The development of science and observation technology in the past five centuries has led humans to understand celestial bodies free from the veil of mythology. <span id="more">Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) with his refractor telescope was able to make the human eye "sharper" in observing celestial objects that could not be observed with the naked eye.
                
                    Because Galileo's telescope could observe more sharply, he could see various changes in the appearance of Venus, such as Crescent Venus or Full Moon Venus as a result of changes in Venus' position relative to the Sun.<br><br> The reasoning about Venus revolving around the Sun further strengthens the heliocentric theory, namely that the Sun is the center of the universe, not the Earth, which was previously proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543). The heliocentric arrangement is the Sun surrounded by Mercury and Saturn.Galileo's telescope continued to be perfected by other scientists such as Christian Huygens (1629–1695) who discovered Titan, a satellite of Saturn, which is almost twice the orbital distance between Earth and Jupiter.
        
                    The development of telescopes was also accompanied by developments in calculating the motion of celestial bodies and their relationships with each other through Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) with Kepler's Laws. And the peak, Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) with the law of gravity. These two calculation theories make it possible to further search and calculate celestial bodies.
                    
                    In 1781, William Herschel (1738–1822) discovered Uranus. Calculations carried out on Uranus' orbit found that the planet's orbit was influenced by other celestial bodies that were not yet known at that time.<br><br> Using the same calculations, astronomers discovered Neptune in 1846.
                    
                    The discovery of Neptune was not enough to explain the disturbances in Uranus' orbit. This condition gave rise to the hypothesis of another planet, "Planet X", which has not yet been discovered. This search led to the discovery of Pluto in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh. At the time Pluto was discovered, this object was only known to be the only space object outside the orbit of Neptune. In 1978, Charon, the largest moon orbiting Pluto, was discovered. Charon was discovered through analysis of photographic plates which showed a "bump" on the side of Pluto.
                    
                    Astronomers then discovered about 1,000 other small objects beyond Neptune (called trans-Neptunian objects), which also revolve around the Sun.<br><br> There are around 100,000 similar objects known as Kuiper Belt Objects (the Kuiper Belt is part of the trans-Neptunian objects). Dozens of celestial bodies are included in the Kuiper Belt Objects including Quaoar (1,250 km in June 2002), Huya (750 km in March 2000), Sedna (1,800 km in March 2004), Orcus, Vesta, Pallas, Hygiea, Varuna, and 2003 EL61 (1,500 km in May 2004).
                    
                    The 2003 discovery of EL61 was quite a sensation because this Kuiper Belt object was known to also have a satellite in January 2005 even though it was smaller than Pluto. And the peak was the discovery of UB 313 (2,700 km in October 2003) which was named by its discoverer Xena. Apart from being bigger than Pluto, this object also has satellites.</span></p>

                        The sun is a ball of fire that is very large in size. The sun can also be called a star. Stars are called the sun because stars are the center of the solar system. The sun is the center of the solar system cluster.<br><br>
                        Apart from that, stars are called the sun because the sun has its own light. If you pay attention, the sun has brighter light than other stars. This happens because the sun is the star that is closest to the earth's structure.

                    <p>
                        Mercury or Utarid is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. This planet's revolution period is the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System, namely 87.79 days. Like Venus, Mercury is an inferior planet whose orbit is located inside Earth's orbit, and when observed from Earth, its angular distance from the Sun never exceeds 28°. Due to its close distance to the Sun, this planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, or usually at dusk. Mercury will appear like a bright star when observed at this time, but is often much more difficult to observe than Venus. If observed from a telescope, Mercury will display a series of phases similar to the phases of Venus and the Moon, when it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth and occurs repeatedly in one synodic cycle, which is around 116 days.                    </p>

                        Venus, Kejora (Malay), Makbram (Biak) or Zohrah is the second closest planet to the Sun after Mercury. This planet orbits the Sun for 224.7 Earth days. Venus has no natural satellites and is named after the goddess of love and beauty in Roman mythology. After the Moon, this planet is the brightest natural object in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of −4.6 which is bright enough to cast a shadow. Venus is an inferior planet with an elongation angle of 47.8°. This planet's maximum brightness can be seen immediately before sunrise or after sunset, so it is called the Morning Star or Evening Star.                    </p>

                        Earth is the third closest planet to the Sun and is the densest and fifth largest planet of the eight planets in the Solar System. Earth is also the largest of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System. Earth is sometimes called the world or "Blue Planet".<br><br>                    
                        The Earth was formed about 4.54 billion years ago, and life appeared on its surface at least 3.5 billion years ago. The Earth's biosphere then slowly changes the atmosphere and other basic physical conditions, allowing the proliferation of organisms and the formation of the ozone layer, which together with the Earth's magnetic field blocks harmful solar radiation and allows microscopic living creatures to reproduce safely on land. The physical properties, geological history and orbit of the Earth allow life to continue to survive.

                    <p>
                        Mars, Marikh (from Arabic مریخ), Jaka belek (from Javanese ꦗꦏꦧꦼꦭꦺꦏ꧀) or Sangia (Tolaki language) is the fourth closest planet to the Sun. Its name is taken from the Roman god of war, Mars. This planet is often nicknamed the "red planet" because it appears reddish from afar. This is caused by the presence of iron(III) oxide on the surface of the planet Mars. Mars is a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere. On the surface of Mars there are craters, volcanoes, valleys, deserts and ice caps. The rotation period and seasonal cycles of Mars are similar to those of Earth. On Mars stands Olympus Mons, the highest mountain in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, the largest valley in the Solar System. Apart from that, in the northern hemisphere there is the Borealis basin which covers 40% of the surface of Mars

                        Jupiter, Kumbendi (Bak language) or Musytari, sometimes informally referred to as Jupiter, is the fifth closest planet to the Sun after Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. This planet is also the largest planet in the Solar System. Jupiter is a gas giant with a mass one thousandth the mass of the Sun and two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System. This planet and the other gas giants in the Solar System (namely Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) are sometimes called the Jovian planets or outer planets. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since ancient times, and is associated with the mythology and religious beliefs of many civilizations. The Romans named this planet after the god Jupiter in Roman mythology. When observed from Earth, Jupiter's apparent magnitude can reach −2.94, which is bright enough to cast shadows, and also makes it the third brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus, although Mars can match Jupiter's brightness at times.
